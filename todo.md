1. make use of second matrix
2. plot distance from the correct positions for errors
3. large scale learning (all KITTI)
4. tune stereo paremeters for our descriptor
5. compare against mc-cnn on stereo
6.
    a.implement simple entropy cost. 
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
7.  
    a.implement complex entropy cost
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
