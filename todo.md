*1. make use of second matrix
*2. plot distance from the correct positions for errors
*3. large scale learning (all KITTI)
3. visualize distance matrix: mask it, compute softmax
4. set up processing on cluster
5. tune stereo paremeters for our descriptor
6. compare against mc-cnn on stereo
7.
    a.implement simple entropy cost. 
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
7.  
    a.implement complex entropy cost
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
