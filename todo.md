*1. make use of second matrix
*2. plot distance from the correct positions for errors
*3. large scale learning (all KITTI)
*4. visualize distance matrix: mask it, compute softmax
*5. set up processing on cluster
6. tune stereo paremeters for our descriptor
7. compare against mc-cnn on stereo

8.
    a.implement simple entropy cost. 
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
9.  
    a.implement complex entropy cost
    b.test that it works.
    c.analyse difference between it and previous: distances from correct, error
10.match number of layers in our and mc-cnn fst net and retrain
   
   
% ideas
1. dynamic programming (self learning)
2. learn smoothness cost and reiterate (self learning)
3. training data is errorneous
